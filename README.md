This is my own fork of suckless dwm combined with Torrinfail's dwmblocks rolled into one, specifically targetting desktops.

### Requirements
You will need alacritty, and the liberation mono font. Alternatively, you can modify blocks.def.h and config.def.h to change the requirements.

### Installation
Simply run the following command:
```bash
sudo make clean install
```
